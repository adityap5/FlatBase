This MERN project enables users to search for hotels based on location and book accommodations by selecting their check-in and check-out dates. The tech stack includes:

- *MongoDB* for the database
- *Express.js* for the backend framework
- *React.js* for the frontend framework
- *Node.js* for the server environment

For icons, we utilize *Material Icons, and for styling, we use **Tailwind CSS*.
